# Creating Users

Learn about creating users in directus, including API creation, inviting users, and seamless invites.

A user is an item in the `directus_users` collection. There are no required fields by default, although you may choose to require values for any system or user-created fields.

To log in with an `email` and `password` they must be set on the user item. A user can also have a [role](https://directus.io/docs/guides/auth/access-control) and any number of policies that can be assigned in the user detail page.

There are three ways to create new users in Directus - registration, creation, and invitation.

## [Register a User](https://directus.io/docs/guides/auth/creating-users\#register-a-user)

The user registration feature is disabled by default. To make use of it, it must first be enabled via project settings. By enabling user registration, it is open to anyone via the Data Studio or via API. Once enabled, all users who register will receive the role configured in project settings.

The Register a User endpoint also only supports `first_name` and `last_name` fields to be set.

POST /register

```
{
  "email": "hello@example.com",
  "password": "d1r3ctu5"
}

```

Regardless of whether the registration was successful or not, the Directus API will always respond with an empty `204` response.This is to mitigate potentially leaking the identity of registered users.

### [Email Verification & Validation](https://directus.io/docs/guides/auth/creating-users\#email-verification-validation)

If enabled in project settings, newly-registered users will receive the `Unverified` status and will be unable to log in until they click the verification link sent via email.

You may also create custom email filter rules to ensure the registering user's email matches certain patterns or has certain characteristics. All string filters are available.

### [Seamless Registration](https://directus.io/docs/guides/auth/creating-users\#seamless-registration)

You can use the verification system within your own application ensuring users do not need to access the Data Studio.

When using the register user endpoint, add a `verification_url` property. The registration email will use this URL, appending a verification token in the URL as a `token` parameter.

Your application must extract this value and send a GET request to the verify email endpoint, with the token appended as a `token` parameter.

```
GET /users/register/verify-email?token=<token>

```

The `USER_REGISTER_URL_ALLOW_LIST` environment variable must be configured.

## [Create a New User](https://directus.io/docs/guides/auth/creating-users\#create-a-new-user)

The Users API can also create a new user. Any field in the `directus_users` collection can be set when creating a user, but the correct public collection permissions will be required.

POST /users

```
{
  "email": "hello@example.com",
  "password": "d1r3ctu5",
  "role": "c86c2761-65d3-43c3-897f-6f74ad6a5bd7"
}

```

See all parameters and payload options for the create user endpoint.

## [Inviting Users](https://directus.io/docs/guides/auth/creating-users\#inviting-users)

Inviting a user will send an email with an invite URL. Once invited, the user will be created with the provided email address and a status of `invited`. When a user accepts their invite they must provide a password and will be able to log in.

POST /users/invite

```
{
  "email": "hello@example.com",
  "role": "c86c2761-65d3-43c3-897f-6f74ad6a5bd7"
}

```

An email service must be configured to send invites.

### [Seamless Invites](https://directus.io/docs/guides/auth/creating-users\#seamless-invites)

You can use the invite system within your own application ensuring users do not need to access the Data Studio.

When using the invite user endpoint, add an `invite_url` property. The invite email will use this URL instead of your Directus project, appending the invite token in the URL as a `token` parameter.

Your application must extract this value, collect the new user's password, and send both to the accept invite endpoint.

POST /users/invite/accept

```
{
  "token": "eyJh...KmUk",
  "password": "d1r3ctu5"
}

```

The `USER_INVITE_URL_ALLOW_LIST` environment variable must be configured.
